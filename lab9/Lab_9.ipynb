    "# DSGA1007 - Programming for Data Science Lab\n",
    "Comprehensive example using most of the concepts we have learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this Lab is to build a toy library to perform hypothesis testing.\n",
    "The idea is to have in mind the usual criteria that we have used to evaluate the quality of a software product.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "- The program produces the correct output when run using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception/Error Handling\n",
    "- All possible exceptions are handled correctly\n",
    "- The code catches specific exceptions (e.g. KeyboardInterrupt) rather than using a catchall statement\n",
    "- Invalid user input is handled correctly (when input is required by the assignment)\n",
    "- User defined exception(s) are employed for indicating error conditions rather than raising generic exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "- The main program contains a comment that lists the authors, and describes the overall program behavior\n",
    "- Comments are used to explain intent and/or warn of consequences where appropriate\n",
    "- Doc strings are used to describe each function\n",
    "- Comments are used to document public methods in the class\n",
    "- There is no commented out code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "- At least one class is used\n",
    "- The class is in separate module from main program\n",
    "- Modules are used to structure the program\n",
    "- The program is correctly structured as a Python package\n",
    "- The code is easily understandable (i.e. divided into logical sections, well structured, etc.)\n",
    "- The code uses meaningful names for variables, functions, and methods, and avoids “Hungarian” notation\n",
    "- Function/method bodies are kept small\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "- Unit tests are provided with the solution code\n",
    "- The unit tests pass correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing Overview by Example\n",
    "We will describe the Hypothesis Testing framework using the [Professional Hockey DatabaseData on hockey players, teams, and coaches from 1909 to 2011](https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/professional-hockey-database) as an example to build a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framwork works as follows:\n",
    "We formulate a Null Hypothesis (H0) and an alternative Hypothesis (H1).\n",
    "In our case we will test whether the average goals scored in 2011 by players who are born in the first 3 months of the year (Group_A) is higher than the average goals scored in 2011 by players who are born in the rest of the year (Group_B). This test is motivated by [Malcolm Gladwell Outliers](http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/52014/index2.html) example on Canadian Hockey players. If you don't know Malcom Gladwell I sugest looking his [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/speakers/malcolm_gladwell), it has nothing to do with Python or Hypothesis Testing, but they are cool :)\n",
    "\n",
    "**H0: mean(Group_A['G']) - mean(Group_B['G']) = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1: mean(Group_A['G']) - mean(Group_B['G']) > 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that mean(Group_A['G']) - mean(Group_B['G']) is just a single quantity that summarizes the data, we will call this a Test Statistic. We need to establish (by assumption or by estimation) a distribution for this Test Statistic under the Null Hypothesis (If we assume that H0 is true, how would the Test Statistic be distributed). We will assume that the distribution of two sample means is Normal and the calculcation for the parameters will be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signifficance of a Hypothesis Test (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. We can think of it as a threshold for the probability of the Test Statistic for our data. This is established for a certain test beforehand (5% is usually used).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to check if the probability of the Test Statistic value for the data given its distribution (called p-value) is lower than the threshold we established then we can reject the null hypothesis."
